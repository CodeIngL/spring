/**
 * A {@code TargetSource} is used to obtain the current "target" of
 * an AOP invocation, which will be invoked via reflection if no around
 * advice chooses to end the interceptor chain itself.
 *
 * <p>If a {@code TargetSource} is "static", it will always return
 * the same target, allowing optimizations in the AOP framework. Dynamic
 * target sources can support pooling, hot swapping, etc.
 *
 * <p>Application developers don't usually need to work with
 * {@code TargetSources} directly: this is an AOP framework interface.
 *
 * <p>
 *     TargetSource用于获取AOP调用的当前“目标”，如果没有周围的建议选择结束拦截器链本身，则将通过反射调用该目标。
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *      如果TargetSource是“静态的”，它将始终返回相同的目标，允许在AOP框架中进行优化。 动态目标源可以支持池，热交换等。
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *      应用程序开发人员通常不需要直接使用TargetSources：这是一个AOP框架接口。
